To get isolation, we can \u201csandbox\u201d applications so that they have their own blocks of memory that only they can access and no other application can touch. Virtual Machines (VMs) are one way to accomplish this at the system level instead of at the application level. With VMs, one can run different virtual operating systems on the same computing system so that an attacker who compromises any one VM cannot, in theory, get to any other VM."),n.a.createElement(f.a,{fontSize:"1.5em",mb:5,mx:5},"Anti-virus software is often an attempt to discover and combat threats to system and application level security.

I hope you\u2019ll forgive my not going into too much detail about any one type of attack or defense strategy. Of course, there are also many things that I did not even begin to cover \u2014 for example, network security, side-channel attacks or encryption. Alas, there is only so much time. Perhaps if there is more interest, I\u2019ll expand on the topic in the near future. If an attacker installs malware that compromises the host computer\u2019s operating system, how can we be sure that the authentication and access control programs don\u2019t have a backdoor that let attackers in?")),n.a.createElement($,null))}var ee=a(126);function te(){var e=Object(q.a)(["\n\tcolor: #e0e0e0;\n\ttext-decoration: underline;\n"]);return te=function(){return e},e}function ae(){var e=Object(q.a)(["\n\tdisplay:flex;\n\tflex-direction: row;\n"]);return ae=function(){return e},e}function oe(){var e=Object(q.a)(["\n\tdisplay: flex;\n\twidth: 99vw;\n\tpadding: 56px;\n\tbackground-color: #212121;\n\tbox-sizing: border-box;\n"]);return oe=function(){return e},e}var ne=D.a.div(oe()),re=D.a.div(ae()),ie=D.a.a(te());function se(){return n.a.createElement(ne,null,n.a.createElement(ee.a,{maxWidth:"960px",mx:"auto"},n.a.createElement(re,null,n.a.createElement(u.a,{variant:"paragraph",align:"left"},n.a.createElement(f.a,{m:3,fontSize:"1.2rem",fontWeight:400},n.a.createElement(ie,{target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer",href:"https://medium.com/@scyrus89/a-non-technical-introduction-to-cybersecurity-f4d42b9a1ff2"},"Source(medium)")),n.a.createElement(f.a,{m:3,fontSize:"1.2rem",fontWeight:400,color:"#e0e0e0"},"Written by:  ",n.a.createElement(ie,{target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer",href:"https://medium.com/@scyrus89"},"Sauvik Das"))))))}var ce=a(64),le=Object(ce.a)({palette:{primary:{light:"#757de8",main:"#3f51b5",dark:"#002984",contrastText:"#efefea"},secondary:{light:"#484848",main:"#212121",dark:"#000000",contrastText:"#efefef"}}}),me=a(127);var he=function(){return n.a.createElement(n.a.Fragment,null,n.a.createElement(me.a,{theme:le},n.a.createElement(M,null),n.a.createElement(Z,null),n.a.createElement(se,null)))};Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));i.a.render(n.a.createElement(n.a.StrictMode,null,n.a.createElement(he,null)),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((function(e){e.unregister()})).catch((function(e){console.error(e.message)}))}},[[74,1,2]]]);
